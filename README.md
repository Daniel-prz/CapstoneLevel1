# Capstone Project Title

Music Shop

## Project Description

My project is a mock online shopping website for instruments. My project will be
coded with HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript; with a focus on responsive design.

---

## Problem Statement

Both opening up a full-fledged physical store and in-store shopping can be a hassle. Online shopping has bridged that gap for both producers and consumers.
A presentable and practical online shopping website can open doors to those that want to open a business from the comfort of home and a laptop; it can also bring an increase of customer base and sales to already existing physical stores. This is where projects just like this one come into play.

## Final Reflection

Coding this project was both an eye-opening and enjoyable learning experience.
Trying to utilize what I've learned thus far into a practical and presentable project was a very fun and educational challenge that I know has further reinforced my current knowledge. Seeing what I can do so far after 2 months of learning has been as humbling and motivating as it was fulfilling, as I know this is just the beginning and I have much more learn and apply in future projects.

In this project, I was able to use much of what I've learned in HTML and CSS, but not so much my knowledge in JavaScript, contrary to as planned. I know JavaScript to be a very useful tool and I look to improve and prove my practical application of it in further projects.

Overall, learning to code has been a great decision. I can see myself learning much more and turning my skills into a career.
